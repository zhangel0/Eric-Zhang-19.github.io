Syringe pumps are commonly used in many biological, chemical, and engineering laboratories. Regardless of the substance that is within these syringe pumps, having to constantly pump these substances into numerous test tubes can be extremely time consuming. Furthermore, when flowrate is important, pumping by hand will not yield the most consistent flowrate over time. This automated syringe pump takes a few steps towards making pumping syringes more convenient and consistent.

The syringe pump comes with two different sized syringe mounts - one 5 mL and one 20 mL. One toggle push button is used to activate the pumping of the syringe and one manual push button is used to retract the syringe after the substance has been fully pumped out. The manual push button can also be used to refill the syringes if necessary. As a safety precaution, a limit switch is incorporated to stop the syringe pump automatically once all of the substance is pumped out. For the user, an LED indicator will light up green when the syringe pump is pumping, yellow when it is paused, red when it is empty, and blue when it is being retracted. To control the pumping speed, simply go into the Arduino code and input the desired flowrate. The code will automatically calculate the motor speed required to fulfill the flowrate.
