# Project Purpose 

The purpose of this project is to design a set of pliers around certain design constraints and parameters. The primary design constraints are that this plier should be usable immediately after the printing process (with the exception of removing necessary support material from the print), and that the plier should be designed to be printed on a dual extruder Makergear 3D printer that will print TPU and PLA. These constraints mean that the plier must be printed in one print as one piece, and that the TPU and PLA parts must be mechanically interlocked in the design since they are dissimilar materials that will not naturally adhere to one another. Other parameters include that the pliers should be able to pick up small pieces down to 3 mm in diameter, and the included spring component of the pliers should return the pliers to its original resting position after use.
