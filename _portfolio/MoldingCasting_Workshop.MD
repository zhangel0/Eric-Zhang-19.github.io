# Workshop Purpose

This workshop exposes students to the Wond'ry makerspace at Vanderbilt by providing them with hands-on experience with one of the many rapid prototyping methods available. The workshops are held officially twice a semester, and unofficial walk-ins throughout the year are also offered to make the workshop available to as many students as possible.

In the workshop, I give students an overview of how to create a two-part mold in SolidWorks using the cavity feature. The molds are 3D printed in advance and provided to the students directly during the workshop. Students who are more interested in the CAD portion have the option to go to the CAD workshop as well. I then give the students a demo of the molding and casting process, and from there the students have the freedom of choosing which molds they would like to use for the workshop.

# Molding & Casting Process

1. Design or import a CAD file of the object you would like a mold of
2. Utilize the cavity feature in SolidWorks (or the combine feature in Fusion 360) to create the mold of your object
3. Fabricate mold with additive manufacturing method
4. If the mold is a two-part mold, tape the two mold parts together and leave tape overhang to contain excess silicone poured during the casting process
5. Make sure tape covers cracks to minimize silicone leaks
6. Obtain Mold Star 20T Part A and Part B Silicone Platinum Rubber
7. Obtain digital scale and paper/plastic cups to weigh and hold the silicone parts
8. Pour and measure out 40 grams of Part A and Part B in separate cups
9. Pour and mix in any decals (i.e. glitter, glow in the dark powder, dyes, etc.) in Part A.
10. Pour the Part B cup into the Part A cup and begin mixing
11. Mix for no more than 2 minutes
12. Pour as much of the mixed silicone into the two-part mold within the next 2 minute period
13. After two minutes, give the mold to the workshop mentor to place into the pressure chamber
14. Leave in pressure chamber for 30 minutes (cure time of the silicone)
15. After 30 minutes, take the mold out of the chamber and remove tape
16. Remove molds parts to reveal silicone shaped object
