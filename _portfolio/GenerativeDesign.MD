# Generative Design Podium
## Purpose

Generative design (GD) is a feature in Fusion 360 that autogenerates designs based off of parameters that you set in the program. This project utilizes generative design to create a custom podium that is compatible on a large format 3D printer (LF3DP) that has approximately 4 x 4 x 4 ft^3 of build volume. This printer cannot print with support material, so generative design is used create a model that can satisfy these parameters. The generated podium will be entered into a competition with other GD podiums to determine the most compatible design with the LF3DP.
