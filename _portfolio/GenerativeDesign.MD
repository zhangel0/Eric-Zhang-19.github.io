# Generative Design Podium
## Purpose

Generative design (GD) is a feature in Fusion 360 that autogenerates designs based off of parameters that you set in the program. This project utilizes generative design to create a custom podium that is compatible on a large format 3D printer (LF3DP) that has approximately 4 x 4 x 4 ft^3 of build volume. This printer cannot print with support material, so generative design is used create a model that can satisfy these parameters. The generated podium will be entered into a competition with other GD podiums to determine the most compatible design with the LF3DP. 

## CAD Models
### GD Workspace

The CAD model above shows the original top of the podium that was designed. This model contains the GD workspace where the constraints, forces, preserve geometries, and obstacle geometries were applied.
### Iteration 1

The CAD model above was one of the ideal results from the first set of GD solutions. This version wasn't bad; however, there were excessive overhangs that were too extreme.
### Iteration 2

This CAD model edited a few of the obstacle and preserve geometries from the first iteration. The result still came out with more extreme overhangs than intended.
