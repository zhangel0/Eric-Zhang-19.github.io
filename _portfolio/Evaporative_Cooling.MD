# Project Purpose

Evaporative cooling is a technology that can control both an environmentâ€™s temperature and humidity. While it can increase and decrease the temperature, the technology is not capable of decreasing humidity levels. This means that the technology is not favorable in humid environments; however, in dry, desert-like conditions, the technology can be very effective.

In 2020, the number of heat stroke cases in military personnel hit a record high. The implementation of a system to reduce exertional heat illness and heat related fatigue in these personnel has become an urgent need. As a result, I partnered with an existing group who were in the process of submitting an STTR grant with Vanderbilt University. The goal of the STTR is to obtain further funding from Vanderbilt to develop a portable cooling and shelter system for military personnel who are stationed in desert-like environments. The purpose of this project was to develop a fully functional low-cost benchtop evaporative cooling prototype to complement the STTR Phase I Proposal.

Typical air conditioning units consume copious amounts of energy due to circulating the refrigerant that cools the air. Furthermore, air has a lower heat capacity than water, meaning the cold air that is blown from an AC unit would heat up quickly after exiting the air conditioner. This makes an evaporative cooling system the ideal system for these military personnel.

# Project Description

This project consists of two main parts: designing the benchtop evaporative cooling prototype and the desert-like controlled environment, and testing the prototype in the environment. Most of the components are off the shelf parts including the fan, pump, filter, tubing systems, etc.

## Benchtop Prototype Parts and Description:
- The fan is used to generate the air flow and forced convection through the system and into the controlled environment.
- An industrial duct reducer was used to connect the fan to the evaporative cooling system.
- Honeywell wooden humidifier filters were used as the means of storing the cold water in the flow path of the air in the evaporative cooling system.
- PVC pipes were cut to size and drilled with evenly spaced 2 mm diameter holes to constantly keep the filters wet with the cold water.
- The pump was stored in the ice bath reservoir to pump water up to the PVC water dispenser.
- A custom 3D printed connector was used to connect the flexible pump tubing to the PVC dispenser. The part was coated with epoxy to prevent leaking.
- An aluminum air duct was used to connect the evaporative cooling system to the controlled environment.

## Controlled Desert-Like Environment

- Closed box environment built from 4 inch thick styrofoam boards. Interior box dimensions were approximately 10 ft x 4 ft x 5 ft or 200 ft3. 
- A dehumidifier was placed inside the closed system to simultaneously decrease the humidity and increase the temperature.
- Temperature and humidity sensors were placed at the bottom and near the top of the box to monitor ongoing conditions.

# Testing

Two primary tests were conducted to validate the efficiency of the system. 

Test 1: Running the dehumidifier only until a max temperature and minimum humidity were reached. Then monitor cooling and humidity levels over time without an evaporative cooling system. 

Test 2: Running dehumidifier until max temperature and minimum humidity were reached. Then connect the evaporative cooling system to the box via air duct, and monitor cooling and humidity increase over time.
