# Project Purpose

Evaporative cooling is a technology that can control both an environmentâ€™s temperature and humidity. While it can increase and decrease the temperature, the technology is not capable of decreasing humidity levels. This means that the technology is not favorable in humid environments; however, in dry, desert-like conditions, the technology can be very effective.

In 2020, the number of heat stroke cases in military personnel hit a record high. The implementation of a system to reduce exertional heat illness and heat related fatigue in these personnel has become an urgent need. As a result, I partnered with an existing group who were in the process of submitting an STTR grant with Vanderbilt University. The goal of the STTR is to obtain further funding from Vanderbilt to develop a portable cooling and shelter system for military personnel who are stationed in desert-like environments. The purpose of this project was to develop a fully functional low-cost benchtop evaporative cooling prototype to complement the STTR Phase I Proposal.

Typical air conditioning units consume copious amounts of energy due to circulating the refrigerant that cools the air. Furthermore, air has a lower heat capacity than water, meaning the cold air that is blown from an AC unit would heat up quickly after exiting the air conditioner. This makes an evaporative cooling system the ideal system for these military personnel.

# Project Description

This project consists of two main parts: designing the benchtop evaporative cooling prototype and the desert-like controlled environment, and testing the prototype in the environment.
