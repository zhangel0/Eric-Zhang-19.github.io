# Project Purpose

Nissan's manufacturing plant in Smyrna, TN has been pushing to fully automate assembly and subassembly processes. One of these subassembly processes includes attaching industrial hose clamps onto engine hoses prior to attaching the hose to the engine itself. The current process sorts clamps automatically, but the hoses must be handled manually. Furthermore the current equipment used for clamp sorting is expensive to maintain and replace. The purpose of this project is to fully automate the hose clamping process by designing a clamp sorting and opening mechanism that is easily maintainable and cheap to replace. The second part of this project utilizes a robot arm that can be programmed to pick up and move the hoses into proper orientations and positions.
