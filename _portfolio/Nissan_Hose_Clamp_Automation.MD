# Project Purpose

Nissan's manufacturing plant in Smyrna, TN has been pushing to fully automate assembly and subassembly processes. One of these subassembly processes includes attaching industrial hose clamps onto engine hoses prior to attaching the hose to the engine itself. The current process sorts clamps automatically, but the hoses must be handled manually. Furthermore the current equipment used for clamp sorting is expensive to maintain and replace. The purpose of this project is to fully automate the hose clamping process by designing a clamp sorting and opening mechanism that is easily maintainable and cheap to replace. The second part of this project utilizes a robot arm that can be programmed to pick up and move the hoses into proper orientations and positions. 

# Project Description

As a Vanderbilt mechanical engineering senior design project, prototyping for this project was split into five large Design, Built, & Test (DBT) cycles over the course of two full semesters. As of February 4, 2023, three of these DBT cycles have been successfully completed and significant progress has been made in all aspects of the design project. Currently for the clamp portion of the project we have a new system to sort the clamps efficiently, dispenses the clamps in a controlled manner, and opens the clamps. For the hose and robot side of the project, we have working robot palletization code, an efficient method of mounting the hoses, and a designed tray add-on to the robot stand to keep everything in the same frame of reference at all times.
