# Project Purpose

Nissan's manufacturing plant in Smyrna, TN has been pushing to fully automate assembly and subassembly processes. One of these subassembly processes includes attaching industrial hose clamps onto engine hoses prior to attaching the hose to the engine itself. The current process sorts clamps automatically, but the hoses must be handled manually. Furthermore the current equipment used for clamp sorting is expensive to maintain and replace. The purpose of this project is to fully automate the hose clamping process by designing a clamp sorting and opening mechanism that is easily maintainable and cheap to replace. The second part of this project utilizes a robot arm that can be programmed to pick up and move the hoses into proper orientations and positions. 

# Project Description

As a Vanderbilt mechanical engineering senior design project, prototyping for this project was split into five large Design, Built, & Test (DBT) cycles over the course of two full semesters. As of February 4, 2023, three of these DBT cycles have been successfully completed and significant progress has been made in all aspects of the design project. Currently for the clamp portion of the project we have a new system to sort the clamps efficiently, dispenses the clamps in a controlled manner, and opens the clamps. For the hose and robot side of the project, we have working robot palletization code, an efficient method of mounting the hoses, and a designed tray add-on to the robot stand to keep everything in the same frame of reference at all times.

## Robot and Tray CAD

The CAD models below depict two tray prototypes that I have been working on for our third DBT cycle. The purpose of the trays is to keep the hoses and the robot arm in the same frame of reference at all times. This is crucial to the functionality of the robot because the robot is coded primarily using the waypoint function, which means the robot is moving using distances and coordinates relative to the robot base. If the robot base moves, then this waypoint is no longer valid for the original hose position unless the hose is moved the same vector distance and direction the robot base moves. The tray attachment eliminates this issue all together.

For the Tray prototype CAD models below, the first CAD model depicts the tray design itself. This CAD model also contains static load analysis that can be viewed by clicking the icon under the cube in the top left corner of the CAD display. The load analysis was done to ensure that the tray would not fail while the hoses are mounted. The second CAD model depicts how the tray will be mounted to the robot base.
