# Project Background 

Friction stir welding (FSW) is the process of welding materials together by heating the materials to their melting points through friction and simultaneously stirring the materials together to create a welded joint. Friction stir extrusion (FSE) is a version of FSW where rather than stirring two side-by-side materials together, the materials are stacked vertically with the bottom piece having a preformed cavity. The same process of FSW is performed directly on the top piece, but now the melted material on top will flow into the cavity of the bottom piece and create a physical joint. FSE is typically used over traditional FSW processes for joining dissimilar materials.

# Project Description

Before combining the thermite with the FSE process, an ideal thermite combination was examined to produce the highest possibility of joint separation. The formation of thermite consisted primarily 30 micron iron oxide powder and 30 micron aluminum powder. The thermite was converted from a powder base to a paste after initial thermite powder burn experiments showed inconsistencies in ignition and volume of powder burned. An ideal paste was formed and utilized in the pyrotechnic joint formation.
