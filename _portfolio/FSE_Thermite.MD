# Project Background 

Friction stir welding (FSW) is the process of welding materials together by heating the materials to their melting points through friction and simultaneously stirring the materials together to create a welded joint. Friction stir extrusion (FSE) is a version of FSW where rather than stirring two side-by-side materials together, the materials are stacked vertically with the bottom piece having a preformed cavity. The same process of FSW is performed directly on the top piece, but now the melted material on top will flow into the cavity of the bottom piece and create a physical joint. FSE is typically used over traditional FSW processes for joining dissimilar materials.

Using thermite to break FSE joints and possibly other mechanical joints creates a cheaper alternative to Lot Acceptance Testing. Furthermore, the use of thermite provides optimistic testing capabilities for space applications since thermite has its own oxygen source.

# Project Description


Before combining the thermite with the FSE process, an ideal thermite combination was examined to produce the highest possibility of joint separation. The formation of thermite consisted primarily 30 micron iron oxide powder and 30 micron aluminum powder. The thermite was converted from a powder base to a paste after initial powder burn experiments showed inconsistencies in ignition and volume of powder burned. An ideal paste was formed and utilized in the pyrotechnic joint formation. 

A 25 mm aluminum block (bottom piece with thermite and cavity) and a 6.35 mm AA6061 alloy block (top piece to be stirred and melted) were used as the two materials for the experiment. Three hole sizes with the following diamaters were used to fill the thermite: 6.35 mm, 9.53 mm, and 13.72 mm with each hole approximately 50 mm deep into the material. An arbor press was used to pack each of the holes with thermite for density and volume consistency. The cavity for the molten AA6061 to flow into was approximately 2 mm by 4 mm prior to FSE process. This cavity was directly above each packed volume of thermite.

Since the thermite paste has an ignition temperature of approximately 2,000Â°C, the thermite was ignited by lighting thin magnesium sheets that would be placed on the surface of the exposed thermite paste. The burning magnesium would then produce enough heat to ignite the thermite paste. Igniting the thermite paste this way was not able to separate the FSE joints created.

Further observations showed that this method of ignition created a gradual release of energy over time rather than the desired release of energy all at once. To make the reaction more explosive, methods of igniting the thermite by running thin 36 gage nichrome and kanthal wires through the entire volume of paste are used. A current of 7 A and a voltage of approximately 34 V was run through the thin wires to ignite the thermite after about six seconds on average.
