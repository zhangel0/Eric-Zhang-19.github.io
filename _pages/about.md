## Work Experience

### Wondry Makerspace Maker Tech

Introducing students to the Wondry Makerspace, and 3D printing and laser cutting projects for students. Running molding and casting workshops open to all students, and teaching students how to use silicone and epoxy molds. Exploring hempcrete as a sustainable material alternative to modern architectural materials for basic structures (chairs, tables, walls, etc.). Providing safety training seminars 2 days a week to new students who are interested in using the mechanical and electrical makerspaces.

With STTR grant approval in mid-November: continuing to develop benchtop prototype from Summer Research 2021 into marketable product prototype from November 2021 to February 2022. Created a large insulated box to simulate a closed system that resembles a hot and dry desert-like environment where certain army camps are set up. Tested benchtop prototype in insulated box to simulate device operation in the desert environment.

### Undergraduate Researcher at VUWAL

Understanding Friction Stir Welding (FSW) processes for plastics and polyesters (forces required, materials properties, etc.) and exploring methods of FSW for PVC tubing. Beginning to prototype and design mini handheld FSW for plastic piping/tubing.

Exploring methods of thermite ignition as a means to successfully break extrusion welds of similar and dissimilar materials without damaging material samples; Evaluating possible applications for underground and underwater structures. Possible alternative method to Lot Acceptance Testing (LAT) for spacecrafts and pyrotechnic joint separation.

### R&D Product & Process Development Intern

Implemented 3D CAD design, 3D printing, and Human Centered Design into Greeniesâ€™ new shape designs and consumer insights testing. 
Evaluated the viability and feasibility of food 3D printer Foodini into MARS product development and deployment processes.
Conducted a wholistic evaluation of CAD and 3D printing for MARS Petcare including options moving forward, costs, desirability, feasibility, and impact of the technologies on existing manufacturing and product development processes.
Utilized Microsoft PowerApps to create a more user-friendly interface for employee/associate information for new hires. Used MS PowerApps to convert onboarding pdf into user-interactive interface.

### NREIP Fall Engagement Intern

#### Fall 2021
Biweekly meetings with NRL professionals Dr. Sophie Colston and Cameron Sayer to discuss research progress and to learn about biomolecular engineering processes including DNA analysis and understanding basic microbial networks and communities of the Chesapeake Bay.

Analyzing given DNA datasets from the Chesapeake Bay with Geneious Prime and uploading to MG-Rast and SILVAngs for further data analysis and feedback. Utilizing analyzed DNA sequences and sorted data to further understand the microbial networks of the Chesapeake Bay.

#### Fall 2022
Improving existing code that analyzes experimental data for slow dynamics of composite materials. Making code more easily understandable and user-friendly.

Assisting in developing a physical model for slow dynamics: reviewing scientific literature on criticality & nonlinear elasticity, developing simulations for an Arrhenius model, and performing analytical calculations.

### Vanderbilt Wondry Innovation Center Research Intern

Utilized evaporative cooling design patent funded by military to develop prototype as STTR supplement. Fabricated iterations of benchtop evaporative cooler prototype and tested in controlled indoor environment.
Hempcrete & sustainable material research/prototyping
Partnering with Tikkun Olam Makers (TOM) members in designing and fabricating motorized swing set for eight-year-old with Cerebral Palsy.
Operating and managing Wondry Makerspace tools (laser cutter, 3D printers, pressure/vacuum chamber, etc.). Optimizing space design of Wondry second floor and fabricating portable workbenches with optimal storage.
Weekly meetings with Wondry staff members including PI Kevin Galloway and Wondry director Dave Owens to discuss research progress and advice. Further discussions included expanding Wondry resources and impact across Vanderbilt campus.

### Teaching Assistant

TA for ME 3890: How To Make Almost Anything. Assist Dr. Galloway with developing new class projects; laser cut and 3D print student CAD projects; assist students with AutoCAD and SolidWorks CAD softwares.
